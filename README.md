# Naruto Memory Card Game

This project is part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-memory-card)'s Javascript curriculum.

## Description
### What is the Naruto Memory Card Game?
A fun memory card game in which the objective is to try to continuously select a unique card as many times in a row as possible.

### Why did I build this project?
An memory card game is the project in the React section of The Odin Project's Javascript Course focused on developing skills involving functional components and hooks. I thought it would be fun to make something using high quality cards so I chose the Naruto Trading Card Game as it provided detailed card images and I really like Naruto.

### My Learning Experience
This was a project I built with React to become comfortable with Functional Components and Hooks. How state functions and how data is shared in a React app was confusing at first but once I read through the official docs and played with the sample code in the React docs I figured it out and made it work.
